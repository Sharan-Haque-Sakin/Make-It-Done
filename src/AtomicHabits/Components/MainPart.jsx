        To understand how our habits are formed,you have to understand how our
        brain work üß†{" "}
      </h3>
      <h1>How our brain works? üß† </h1>
      <p>Our brain usally works in 2 systems :-</p>
      <ul>
        <li className="s">Sytem 1- Automatic</li>
        <li className="s">Sytem 2 - Unconscious</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="s1"># System 1 - Automatic</h1>
      <p id="s1des">
        The automatic system is also known as our Subconscious Mind üß† .When we
        repeat a task or work many times, it gets held in our subconscious
        mind.And from then on ,we don't have to put our brain on work inorder to
        do that.
        <br />
        For example- You are a football player.And you are trying to master a
        New Shot.But at first when you just started,you had to put your brain on
        work and calculate how you wil have to give that shot.What should be
        your body language,how you should use your toe and so on. So for that,
        you repeat that shot over and over and over and over (practise),and at a
        time you discover that you not having of the problem of calculating all
        the positions.You body is automatically going on that position while you
        are giving that shot!Totally automatic!How cool right?
      </p>
      <h1 id="s2"># System 2 - Conscious(‡¶∏‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶§‡¶®)</h1>
      <p id="s2des">
        Well,This is the mind where we act consciously.We do the work what we
        wanna do and can avoid which we don't. For example:- Remembering
        anything.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="n">
        <u style={{ color: "red" }}>What is habit?:-</u> System 1 is what we
        call habit.We repeat enough something that at a time we don't have to
        put our brain on it.We automically do the work on our own.{" "}

      <h1>How a habit get formed‚ùì </h1>
      <p>
        In the way to form a habit,our brain faces these 4 Stages everytime.In
        short,these are the BACKBONE of every habit(But if we repeat anything
        too much time ,that automatically becomes our habit).And these are the
        key stages for a habit to built or never to be repeated again. Those are
        :-
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1.Cue(‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶§)</b>:
          <p>
            {" "}
            {`-->`} In this stage,our brain predcits the reward which it will
            get after taking any action.This is also the first stage of any
            habit for getting formed.If the reward is satisfying,than we are
            more likely to response(Take action).But if the reward is not that
            satisfying,than we are more likely not gonna do that action or
            repeat that in the future.
            <br />

          <b>2.Craving(‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ):</b>
          <p>
            {"-->"} Craving is the second stage-and this is also the motivation
            force behind every habit.Without some level of motivation or
            desire,we have no reason to act.{" "}
            <span style={{ backgroundColor: "orange" }}>
              What we desire is not the habit itself,but the release of
              dopamine-the statisfaction of the reward it's gonna get it
              detects. <br />
            </span>

              <i>DOPAMINE</i>

            is a neurotransmitter(chemical) of our brain for which we feel

          <b>3.Response</b>:
          <p>
            {`-->`}The action we take to get the reward.In simple words,The
            Action. The more easy the action is,the more we will be able and
            motivated to execute it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>4.Reward:</b>
          <p>

            <br />
            The more satisfying it will,the more likey the odds will for while
            repeating it. Once the reward is been gotten,our brain is gonna save
            it and always gonna check this reward and report us when that kind
            of situation will arive.

      <h1>How to Build a good habit and destroy the bad one?</h1>
      <p>
        There are 4 key ways in the book (According to CUE,CRAVE,RESPONSE,REWARD
        system)
        <br />
        Those 1 are-

        Your goal is not to a read book,your goal is to become a reader.
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1.Make it Obvious:</b>
          <p>
            {"-->"} If you wanna build a new habit,than keep that thing infront
            of you.Suppose,you want to build a habit of reading books than don't
            ,where the chance of looking at the book is less.Rather than keep
            your book at a place where you spend your most of the time(Make sure
            that you always look at that place.In short keep the book infront of
            your eyes where you come or spend most of the time). For me ,
            keeping my book (which I am reading) on my table worked
            fine.Whenever I sit in my table,I see my book- grab that and start
            reading.This how I was able to read books atlist 1hour of the day
            time.But,when I am too busy,I simply change the place from table to
            my bed.So that when I got to bed I am able to read the book!When
            reading will be your habit and you will start to enjoy reading, than
            you will able to read even when you are not at that(The time might
            be decrease ,but you will still be able to manage that).

            **There been a fun fact.Nowadays ,I am too busy staying outside that
            I am not being able to sit infront my desk.Magically and
            Dramatically,as I am not being able to sit in my desk for that much
            time,I am also not being able to read books as I used to read!Isn't
            that Dramatic?
            <h3>
              Note ‚úç :For eliminating any habit,just do the opposite-
              <b>MAKE IT INVISIBLE</b>.Keep the thing at a place where you will
              never look at.So the CUE will never trigger,and you will never
              able to do that stuff.

          <b>2.Make it attractive</b>
          <p>
            This is for the second stage-<b>Craving</b>.For example,to start
            reading , you can say to yourself-

            can allow yourself watching youtube for 10 minuites or you can
            scroll social media or hang out with friends )
          </i>
          <p>
            This how you can trick your brain to do hard things and things that
            it don't like to do.And I am using READING as a example of habit.You
            can use this for every habit you wanna make!
          </p>
          <h3>Note ‚úç:To eliminate one,you use the opposite.For example - </h3>
          <h3 style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block", textAlign: "center" }}>
            "If I do {`{Bad Habit}`},I have to do {`{For example - 10 Push Up}`}
            "

        <li>
          <b>3.Make it EASY:</b>
          <p>
            Well,this stage is always after this 2 stages,after making it
            obvious or attractive or both,try to make the work or habit easy so
            you can do it in less effort.Remember,
            <span style={{ backgroundColor: "orange" }}>
              Our brain is too lazy.So it always wants you do the fun and easy
              stuff!
            </span>
            So if you make the work easy enough,you will be more likely to form
            any habit quickly.
          </p>
          <i>
            Note ‚úç:This trick is mainly used to eliminate bad habit(from my
            point of view and according to me.I might be wrong.).For example -{" "}

            me share you a short story-
            <br />
            <br />
            In the late 1990s a public health worker named Stephen Luby left his
            home town and bought a one way ticket to Karachi,Pakistan.
            <br />
            Over 9 million people called it home.It was also the least livable
            city in the world.Over 60% of the population lived in squatter and
            slums.Their was no Healthy environment at all!People suffered in
            illness and deases all over the world.When Luby went their,as he was
            a public health worker he tried to explain to the people about the
            importance of a Hygienic Environment and habits.So the people
            followed his words and start washing thier hands.But the problem
            wasn't knowledge.The problem was Consistency.No one of them were
            washing their hands sincerely.
            <br />
            So Luby tried a Brilliant method.He partnered with a company to
            supply Safe Guard Soap. It was a premium soap in Pakistan.It smelt
            great,felt soft and gave a great experience. So using that give them
            pleasure.So on , that washing hands became their habit.
            <h4>
              After adopting the this habit,the rate of Diarrhea felt by
              52%,pneumonia by 48 and imetigo(a skin deasese) by 35 % !!{" "}
